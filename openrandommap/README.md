Read-me
-------

OpenRandomMap is a web tool to generate random names for web open maps. This is mainly a joke about how open-source maps are named online. This tool is written in JavaScript.

A live demo is available at [github.pavie.info/openrandommap](http://github.pavie.info/openrandommap/).


Usage
-----

OpenRandomMap is simple to use, for real. Just load the page to see a random web map. You can hit refresh button to load another one.
